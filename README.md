[00:12.27] Yeah
[00:14.27] 
[00:13.12] Moving so silent and deadly
[00:14.77] Preying on ya (preying on ya)
[00:16.28] Hidden from light so you can't see
[00:17.77] My 姿 (my 姿)
[00:19.25] Tick on the clock, yeah, it tells me
[00:20.93] It's time to hunt
[00:22.24] So I'ma be free without care in mind
[00:23.61] 'Cause I'm living the life that I want
[00:42.61] 
[00:25.28] I'ma be running my kingdom
[00:26.44] Living by my own reason
[00:28.29] Stuck in the dark, I got a heart even when I'ma be freezing
[00:31.34] Searching for what I can't see
[00:32.88] 暗闇に溶け込み ya
[00:34.42] I never stop, stop
[00:36.07] Hop in the booth and it's hot, hot, yeah
[00:56.07] 
[00:37.86] In the end (end), the story will all unfold (unfold)
[00:42.47] Nothing will be untold (untold)
[00:45.83] The silence will speak on its own
[00:48.85] Its own
[00:51.24] But for now, I'm running on my own road
[00:54.52] 立ち止まらずに進もう
[00:57.54] Counting down, hit zero and then I go
[01:16.04] 
[01:03.20] But for now
[01:06.31] I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:08.81] Like a never-ending pit
[01:12.23] 壁をぶち壊せ
[01:15.34] 'Cause I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:17.50] I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:19.08] I'm stuck but I'm still
[01:30.58] 
[01:19.98] Gliding through the air like a crow
[01:22.05] Never thought I'll
[01:23.01] Make it out of here but here I go
[01:25.23] 'Cause I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:27.04] I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:30.36] I'm stuck in the abyss
[01:31.89] I'm stuck in here
[01:40.39] 
[01:32.78] The day is night (night)
[01:34.61] 真っ暗な世界
[01:36.09] But nothing scary here, it's just the way I like (the way I like)
[01:38.97] The darkness in my soul, the darkness in my eyes (yeah)
[01:42.95] I turn it into energy and fuel my mind
[02:01.95] 
[01:45.19] I'm locked in, no stopping
[01:47.09] I'm feeling like I'm sitting in the cockpit
[01:48.54] I'm lost in my thoughts and
[01:50.01] I'm spitting and releasing all my toxins
[01:51.57] The center of the scene
[01:53.10] Make you bow down on your knees
[01:54.68] 俺は唯一無二 何も怖くない
[01:56.49] Let's go
[02:00.49] 
[01:58.85] In the cold, don't feel it anymore
[02:01.90] 'Cause I know there's light waiting at the door
[02:05.01] Counting down, hit zero and then I go (go) (oh) (oh)
[02:31.01] 
[02:10.30] I'm stuck in the abyss (I'm stuck in the abyss)
[02:11.72] Like a never-ending pit (like a never-ending pit)
[02:16.42] 勝ちを奪い取れ
[02:19.41] 'Cause I'm stuck in the abyss
[02:21.34] I'm stuck in the abyss
[02:23.15] I'm stuck but I'm still heading for the light I'll never fold
[02:25.90] And now I feel invincible and take over the world
[02:29.03] 'Cause I'm stuck in the abyss
[02:31.13] I'm stuck in the abyss
[02:34.26] I'm stuck in the abyss
[02:35.72] I'm stuck in here
[02:44.22] 
[02:38.97] ついて来いよ
[02:41.97] 
[02:52.20] I feel the light hidden behind me
[02:57.19] I'm never gonna let it go
[02:59.56] I feel the colors now combining
[03:03.59] I'm never gonna let it go
[03:05.99] So in the end, we'll find our home
[03:09.95] And what we were destined for
[03:12.44] Goodbye, my friend, the light has come
[03:16.44] I'm never gonna let it go
